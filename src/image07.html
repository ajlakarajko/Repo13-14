                <h1>Swimming</h1>
                <p>
                    Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water,
                    usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival.
                    Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the
                    limbs, the body, or both. Humans can hold their breath
                    underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming
                    within weeks of birth, as a survival response. Swimming is
                    consistently among the top public recreational activities,
                    and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory
                    part of the educational curriculum. As a formalized sport,
                    swimming features in a range of local, national, and
                    international competitions, including every modern Summer
                    Olympics.

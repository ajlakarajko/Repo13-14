                    Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of
                    bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport.
                    People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists",
                    "bicyclists", or "bikers". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles,
                    "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles,
                    quadracycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles
                    (HPVs). Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now
                    number approximately one billion worldwide. They are the
                    principal means of transportation in many parts of the
                    world. Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and
                    efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to
                    moderate distances.
